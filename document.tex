 For instance, 1-planarity cannot be characterized in 
terms of forbidden minors \cite{grigoriev2007algorithms}. 
For a graph with $n$ vertices, it is possible to determine in linear time 
whether the graph is planar or not \cite{hopcroft1974efficient}, even for the 
graphs formed from planar graphs 
by adding a single edge \cite{korzhik2013minimal}.
